Why Choose the Arduino Mega 2560?
- More I/O Pins: 54 digital pins and 16 analog inputs, perfect if you want to expand the hardware (e.g., multiple LEDs or sensors).
- Larger Memory: 256 KB of flash memory, suitable if you need to add more code or libraries.
- Better Serial Communication: 4 hardware serial ports, allowing flexible communication with multiple peripherals.


Hardware Implementation using Arduino Mega 2560
Connections:
LED: Connect to pin 13 (with a 220-ohm resistor).
Buzzer: Connect to pin 8.
Optional Button: Connect a button to pin 7 (with a pull-down resistor) to allow snoozing alerts.

Wiring Example:
LED: Pin 13 → Resistor → LED (positive) → GND
Buzzer: Pin 8 → Buzzer (positive) → GND
Button: Pin 7 → Button → GND
