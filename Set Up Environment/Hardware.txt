# Hardware Setup for ActiveBreaks

## Required Components:
- Arduino Mega 2560
- 1x LED (Any color, for visual reminders)
- 1x Buzzer (Piezo buzzer, for sound alerts)
- 1x Push Button (Optional, for snooze functionality)
- Jumper Wires (for connections)
- Breadboard (for easy wiring)
- USB Cable (for Arduino-computer communication)

## Circuit Diagram:
1. **LED**: 
   - Connect the positive leg (longer leg) to Pin 13 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the negative leg to GND with a 220-ohm resistor in series.

2. **Buzzer**:
   - Connect the positive terminal to Pin 12 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the negative terminal to GND.

3. **Push Button (Optional)**:
   - One side of the button to Pin 2 on the Arduino.
   - The other side to GND.
   - Use a 10k-ohm pull-up resistor between Pin 2 and VCC to stabilize the signal.

4. **Arduino Connection**:
   - Connect the Arduino to the computer via a USB cable to enable communication with the Python script.

## Hardware Test:
- Use the Arduino IDE to upload a simple LED blink sketch to ensure the Arduino and components are connected correctly.
